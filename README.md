# ArgenDev - Project App Web MarkCare


Development of a shift management system for shops called supermarkets and hypermarkets.

This project describes the resources and steps for designing the MarkCare shift management system. It will be developed for Smartphones devices, so that it will be available for download and installation in the system store of said device.
The scope of the system is aimed at those people who want to make their purchases in a more organized and safe way in the context of the pandemic caused by the COD-19 disease, thus promoting social distancing and avoiding the agglutination of people in the shops, in accordance with the provisions of the national government and health specialists.
The management and interface of the system will be user-friendly and intuitive, making it possible for it to be adopted by a wide age range of people.
